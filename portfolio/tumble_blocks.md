*Tumble Blocks* is a 3D spatial puzzle game in which the player rotates and combines blocks to solve levels. I worked on prototyping this project and gained valuable experience.

The main challenge of *Tumble Blocks* was the math-heavy, detailed logic required to program and implement a complex ruleset.
Each move in the 3D environment requires rotating any combination of blocks, simulating the physics of 3D rotational movement and collision of blocks and accommodation of additional rules involving color and breaking and combining blocks under certain situations.
