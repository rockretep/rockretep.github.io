OddestSea is a game about sailing in a dark, eerie sea, evading monsters, and restoring light to the mysterious waters.

I've worked on a variety of tasks in the making of this game:

- Programming
	- Gameplay mechanics
	- AI system and design
	- UI system
	- Physics implementations
- Art
	- Visual effects (in-engine)
	- Shaders (GLSL, Cg)
	- Scene lighting
	- 3D modelling, rigging, and animation
- Project Management
	- Repository management
	- Defining technical constraints
	- Project architechture and organization
	- Technical review and assistance for team

I've always wanted to make a game about sailing. I started this project in summer of 2018 for my Game Design BS capstone course at Indiana University. With the help of many talented artists and others, it's slowly coming together with a planned release on Steam and itch.io in March 2020.
