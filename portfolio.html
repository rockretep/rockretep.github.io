    <h3><i>Charbble</i></h2>
    <p class="tab">
    <i>Charbble</i> is a roguelike inspired word puzzle game. Core mechanics of the classic game Scrabble are applied to unexpected game elements. The goal 
    of the game is to progress through an endless series of levels, surviving on points earned by building words using letters kept the player's inventory.
    </p>
    <p class="tab">
    Charbble's design was focused on developing several small mechanics that are designed to work together in a innovative way. For example, I designed a 
    mechanic that rewards the player with points based on the frequency of use of the word in the English language. Levels are made with procedurally 
    generated word puzzles based on the letters in the player's current inventory. These mechanics work together to create an interesting dynamic by 
    requiring the player to manage their letter inventory in a way that will enable them to continue building words.

    <p class="tab">
    <i>Charbble</i> combines the word puzzle and roguelike genres. In addition to solving Scrabblelike puzzles, enemies take letters from the players inventory, 
    the player moves on a grid level in turn-based fashion, life-score decrements with each move, and all levels and puzzles are procedurally generated.

    <h3>
    Asymars
    </h3>
    <p class="tab">
    Loosely based on chess, <i>Asymars</i> is a two-player, competitive, zero-sum game played on a asymmetrical board with pieces distributed 
    asymmetrically. The game pieces are defined by simple properties defining direction of movement, range of movement, direction of attack, attack range, 
    and HP value. Players take turns moving pieces and attacking enemy pieces until all enemy pieces are eliminated.
    </p>
    <p class="tab">
    I designed the game pieces to have simple properties and rules, which allowed for the efficient implementations of artificial intelligence systems. For example, 
    Alpha-Beta pruning is used in combination with the Minimax algorithm to simulate and reduce game states which ultimately determine the AI player's choices.

    <br/>
    <p class="tab">
    <i>Asymars</i> is asymmetrical in that it can be played on many different board shapes and with combinations of player pieces and types, making for unique, 
    complex relationships that nonetheless emerge from simple properties of gameplay. To accommodate this dynamic, I designed many different heuristics to determine 
    which were most effective with different board and piece configurations and which benefited from first move advantage.

    <h3>Tumble-Blocks</h3>
    <p class="tab">
    <i>Tumble-Blocks</i> is a 3D spatial puzzle game in which the player rotates and combines blocks to solve levels. I worked on prototyping this project and gained valuable experience.

    <p class="tab">
    The main challenge of <i>Tumble-Blocks</i> was the math-heavy, detailed logic required to program and implement a complex ruleset. 
    Each move in the 3D environment requires rotating any combination of blocks, simulating the physics of 3D rotational movement and collision of blocks and accommodation of additional rules involving color and breaking and combining blocks under certain situations.
