This project started out by development a simple AI framework for a couple of projects in the Unity Game Engine. I soon realized that I would like to be able to apply my framework in as many contexts (like other game engines) as possible. So I decided to write it in C, which make it much easier to make bindings for, and makes for great practice to improve my C skills.

I want the framework small, simple, and general-purpose. I admire the __[suckless](https://suckless.org/)__ philosophy.
