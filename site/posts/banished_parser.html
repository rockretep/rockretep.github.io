    <section id="body">
        <p>The working application can be found here:</p>
        <p>I was contracted to design and develop a tool to help
        students in a game statistics and data analysis class. Students
        needed to be able to record data from the game <a
        href="http://www.shiningrocksoftware.com/game/"><em>Banished</em></a>.</p>
        <p><img src="/images/banished.png#right#small"
        title="banished_parser1" loading="lazy"
        data-option="small right" /></p>
        <p>At first I thought this would be a fairly simple task, as
        <em>Banished</em> provides a modding API. I thought I could
        easily extract information via the API, but it turned out that
        the game didn't practically allow for this.</p>
        <p>My next thought was to try and use the game's save files as a
        source for the data, since students only needed 'snapshots' of
        the game state, rather than a continuous stream of data.
        Unfortunately, the save files were in a binary format, and
        despite my efforts to crack the format, I couldn't consistently
        get the pertinent data from the files.</p>
        <p>My next option was to scrape the relevant information from
        screenshots using OCR (optical character recognition) software.
        This was a less than desirable option, due to the many more
        steps required to get the data, and the introduction of
        potential inaccuracy in the data collected. However, it was the
        only option I could think of at that point.</p>
        <p>I didn't want to rely on calls to OCR cloud services, like
        Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud, due to the cost and to have
        more direct interfacing with the API. I decided to use <a
        href="https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com">tesseract.js</a> for
        OCR, in combination with <a href="https://opencv.org">OpenCV</a>
        for pre-processing. Using tesseract.js made the project more
        maintainable for me and allowed for students to access the tool
        on a webpage; I didn't want to distribute a multi-platform
        client to students.</p>
        <p>Since this tool has a very specific use-case, I didn't worry
        about trying to generalize to program to lower the constraints
        of the input data (widget location, resolution and scale, etc.).
        However, I still wanted to make the tool as painless to use; it
        wouldn't be a very good tool if it was difficult to use.</p>
        <p>The basic steps of the program from the input game data to
        output statistics data are as follows: <br>
        <code>Capture screenshot of game with GUI widget with specified configuration --&gt; upload screenshot to web tool --&gt; pre-process and filter screenshot using OpenCV library --&gt; scan processed image data with tesseract.js library --&gt; post-process text data --&gt; format final text data into JSON for download</code></p>
        <h4 id="pre-processing">Pre-processing</h4>
        <p>The problem with screenshots from the game is that there is
        so much variability that I had to account for, or try to
        constrain. In order to successfully process and parse data from
        in-game screenshots of <em>Banished</em>, there were many
        hurdles that I needed to consider (or ignore). The pertinent
        data that the students needed for their statistical analysis is
        as follows:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Time <em>(date/time captured, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO8601</a>
        format)</em></li>
        <li>Season <em>(string, in-game season)</em></li>
        <li>Year <em>(integer, in-game year)</em></li>
        <li>Population <em>(integer quantity)</em>:
        <ul>
        <li>Total population</li>
        <li>Adults</li>
        <li>Students</li>
        <li>Children</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Resources <em>(integer quantity)</em>:
        <ul>
        <li>Log</li>
        <li>Stone</li>
        <li>Iron</li>
        <li>Firewood</li>
        <li>Coal</li>
        <li>Tool</li>
        <li>Food</li>
        <li>Herb</li>
        <li>Coat</li>
        <li>Ale</li>
        <li>Leather</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Conveniently all of this information is located in one UI
        widget/window in the game. So if my program knows where that UI
        element is positioned in the input screenshot, I can crop out
        the rest of the image to only include the relevant data.</p>

        <pre><code>function processScreenshot(e) {
    let t = cv.imread(e);
    let n = new cv.Mat;
    let r = new cv.Size(
        BASEREGION.width * UPSCALE * BASESCALE,
        BASEREGION.height * UPSCALE * BASESCALE);
    cv.cvtColor(t, t, cv.COLOR_RGBA2GRAY, 0),
    t = t.roi(scaleRect(new cv.Rect(0, 0, 300, 170), BASESCALE)),
    cv.resize(t, t, r, 0, 0, cv.INTER_AREA),
    cv.bilateralFilter(t, n, 11, 12, 12, cv.BORDER_DEFAULT),
    t.delete(),
    cv.threshold(n, n, 122, 255, cv.THRESH_BINARY),
    cv.bitwise_not(n, n),
    cv.medianBlur(n, n, 3),
    cv.imshow(&quot;imageOut&quot;, n),
    n.delete()
}</code></pre>
